# Directory for user-defined Korn Shell functions
#
# Files in this directory (ONLY) will be sourced for inclusion/availability 
# from the command line.  To enable a function, simply define it here.  To 
# enable a pre-populated function from the library (c.f the sub-directories 
# under this directory), copy or hard-link the desired function(s) to this 
# directory, e.g: 
#
# ln git/w{r,b} .
#
# to enable the wr() and wb() user-defined Git functions.
